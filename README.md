Data management issue tracking

Before data can be displayed in the Atlas of Living Australia (Atlas) it is subject to a data integration process consisting of:
  1. [Data mobilisation](http://www.ala.org.au/about-the-atlas/how-we-integrate-data/data-mobilisation/) —getting the data into the Atlas
  2. [Data quality assurance](http://www.ala.org.au/about-the-atlas/how-we-integrate-data/data-quality-assurance/) —checking various aspects of the data, eg the current species name
  3. [Data sensitivity check](http://www.ala.org.au/about-the-atlas/how-we-integrate-data/data-sensitivity-checks/) —to identify if the data relates to a species that is sensitive for reasons of conservation or biosecurity.
