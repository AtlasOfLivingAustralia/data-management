Data management issue tracking

Before data can be displayed in the Atlas of Living Australia (Atlas) it is subject to a data integration process consisting of:
  Data mobilisation —getting the data into the Atlas
  Data quality assurance —checking various aspects of the data, eg the current species name
  Data sensitivity check —to identify if the data relates to a species that is sensitive for reasons of conservation or biosecurity.
